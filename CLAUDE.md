# Divergence

A precision-first analyzer for MCP servers and agent skills. It measures the gap
between what an artifact **claims** to do and what it **actually** does —
statically first, then confirmed in a sandbox.

The full build specification is **`build-plan/divergence-spec.html`** (v2, scope
locked). Read it before planning any work. It is the source of truth for scope,
architecture, phase sequence and exit gates — this file does not restate it.

## Status

**P0 complete** (2026-08-19). Benchmark harness and 80-sample corpus land before any
detection code, per §07. `make bench` reproduces the baseline comparison table byte-for-byte
from a clean checkout; `null` and `keyword` reference scanners are in-repo, third-party
scanners are wired but gated behind `DIVERGENCE_ALLOW_EXTERNAL=1`. Next: **P1 — deterministic
core** (A1 acquisition, A2 declared-interface analyzer, A3 manifest ledger), no inference.

## Core rule

A finding is the **gap**, not the capability. A shell-execution server executing
shells is not a finding. A shell-execution server that never said it would touch
the network is.

Output splits into two channels that never mix:

- **Posture** — what an artifact *can* do. Non-urgent. Never counts toward the verdict.
- **Risk** — divergence between representations. Only these count toward the verdict.

## Phase discipline

Phases P0–P6 each have an exit gate in §07 of the spec. **Do not start a phase
until the previous gate passes.** The ship checkpoint after P4 is load-bearing:
v1 ships before any Rust sandbox work begins, even if the sandbox looks more
interesting that week.

## Phase reports

At the end of each phase, write an HTML progress report to
`build-plan/reports/phase-NN-<slug>.html`, styled to match `build-plan/divergence-spec.html`
(same fonts, same `:root` palette). Local file only — do not publish it anywhere.
Report what actually landed, what is blocked, and what needs a decision.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and specs live as local markdown under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, using their default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
